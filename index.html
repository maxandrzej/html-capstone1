        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! Im 17 years old and Im from Poland.<br />
            My high school is fully remote, which gives more time to do what you want.<br />
            I decided to start learning web development through online bootcamp<br />
            leaded by dr Angela Yu from London App Brewery:

        <p>
            My goal is to become professional programmer and earn money.<br />
            Im planning to use it to gain independence and buy home.<br />
            I also want to visit South Korea one day because I like kpop xd<br />
            Also planning to donate part of my future earning to charity<br />
            because always there is someone within worse situation than me<br />
            and its often not neccesarily fault of this person (take sick children<br />
            or someone born in very poor conditions for example).<br />
            I am democratic socialist & preference utilitarian.
